				GeoIP 1.3.7
				-----------

IMPORTANT API Change for 1.3.x and above users for GeoIP Region database
GeoIPRegion.region is no longer a pointer but an in-structure
array so test the first byte of region == 0 rather testing if the region
pointer is NULL.

IMPORTANT API Change for 1.1.x and above users - as of GeoIP 1.1.0 the
GeoIP_country_xxx_by_xxx functions return NULL if a country can not
be found (it used to return '--' or 'N/A'.  Be sure to check the
return value for NULL, to avoid segmentation faults!

GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find the country that any
IP address or hostname originates from.  It contains a free GeoIP Country database
that is updated every month.  This database simply contains IP blocks
as keys, and countries as values.  This database should be more complete and
accurate than using reverse DNS lookups.  We also offer a paid database
that has greater accuracy than the free version, as well as paid databases
with city level resolution.  For more details see:

This module can be used to automatically select the geographically closest
mirror, to analyze your web server logs to determine the countries of your
visitors, for credit card fraud detection, and for software export controls. 

To install, run:

./configure
make
make check
make install

MEMORY CACHING AND OTHER OPTIONS

There are three options available:

GEOIP_STANDARD - read database from filesystem, uses least memory.

GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE - load database into memory, faster performance
	but uses more memory

GEOIP_CHECK_CACHE - check for updated database.  If database has been updated,
	reload filehandle and/or memory cache.

EXAMPLES

See
test/
     test-geoip.c
     test-geoip-region.c
     test-geoip-city.c
     test-geoip-isp.c
     test-geoip-org.c
     test-geoip-netspeed.c

For examples of how to use the API.  The test-geoip.c works with both the free and paid
GeoIP Country databases.  The other example programs require the paid databases available
from http://www.maxmind.com/app/products

AUTOMATIC UPDATES

MaxMind offers a service where you can have your database updated
automically each month.  For more details see:

TROUBLESHOOTING

Note that it is recommended that you use GNU make.  Also, if you are using
OpenBSD, GeoIP requires OpenBSD 3.1 or greater.

if you get "cannot load shared object file: No such file or directory"
error, add the directory libGeoIP.so was installed to to /etc/ld.so.conf
and run ldconfig

On Solaris, if you get a
ld: fatal: relocations remain against allocatable but non-writable sections
error, try running

# make clean
# ./configure --disable-shared
# make

If you get a "ar : command not found" error, make sure that ar is
in your path.  On Solaris, ar is typically found in /usr/ccs/bin

If you get a "geoipupdate.c:24: getopt.h: No such file or directory"
error, run

# export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"

(assuming that getopt.h is in /usr/local/include)
