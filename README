				GeoIP 1.2.0
				-----------

IMPORTANT API Change for 1.1.x and above users - as of GeoIP 1.1.0 the
GeoIP_country_xxx_by_xxx functions return NULL if a country can not
be found (it used to return '--' or 'N/A'.  Be sure to check the
return value for NULL, to avoid segmentation faults!

GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find the country that any
IP address or hostname originates from.  It uses a file based database
that is accurate as of March 2003.  This database simply contains IP blocks
as keys, and countries as values.  This database should be more complete and
accurate than using reverse DNS lookups. 

This module can be used to automatically select the geographically closest
mirror, to analyze your web server logs to determine the countries of your
visitors, for credit card fraud detection, and for software export controls. 

To install, run:

./configure
make
make check
make install

AUTOMATIC UPDATES

If you are a GeoIP subscriber, you can update your database automatically
each month.  To perform the update, simply run:

geoipupdate

To fully automate this process, use a crontab file like:

# top of crontab
MAILTO=your@email.com

3 33 1 * * /usr/local/bin/geoipupdate -v
# end of crontab

This crontab file will run at the first of each month, and it will email
you the results.  To apply the crontab file run

$ crontab cronfile

TROUBLESHOOTING

Note that it is recommended that you use GNU make.  Also, if you are using
OpenBSD, GeoIP requires OpenBSD 3.1 or greater.

if you get "cannot load shared object file: No such file or directory"
error, add the directory libGeoIP.so was installed to to /etc/ld.so.conf
and run ldconfig

On Solaris, if you get a
ld: fatal: relocations remain against allocatable but non-writable sections
error, try running

# make clean
# ./configure --disable-shared
# make

If you get a "ar : command not found" error, make sure that ar is
in your path.  On Solaris, ar is typically found in /usr/ccs/bin

If you get a "geoipupdate.c:24: getopt.h: No such file or directory"
error, run

# export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"

(assuming that getopt.h is in /usr/local/include)
